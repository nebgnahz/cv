      Optimize wide-area crawling scheduling. Designed and implemented a global
      DNS sharding system based on locality rather than hash partition. The
      system runs in production and has effectively reduced the 99-percentile
      latency and cross-datacenter traffic.

    \begin{cvitems}
      \item \textbf{LiveSynergy}: Evaluated various technologies (802.15.4, Bluetooth
      Low Energy, and RFID) on metrics like boundary sharpness, consistency,
      range, power consumption for indoor localization. Led the design and
      implementation of a magnetic-based proximity detection hardware platform.
      \item \textbf{SEPTIMU}: Designed the hardware platform (1cm by 1cm) which
      integrates 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, thermometer, photo-diode and
      microphone.

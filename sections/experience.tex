    \begin{cvitems}
      System research for mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) applications (see
      research projects for details).

    \begin{cvitems}
      An exploration of using Android and Bluetooth LE to implement a
      wireless-sensor Data Mule system.

  {Google, Search Infrastructure}
  {Mountain View}
  {May. 2014 -- Aug. 2014}
  {
    \begin{cvitems}
      Optimized wide-area crawling scheduling. Designed and implemented a global
      DNS sharding system based on target locality rather than hash
      partition. The system runs in production and has effectively reduced
      99-percentile latency and cross-datacenter traffic.

  {
    \begin{cvitems}
      \item \textbf{LiveSynergy}. Evaluated various technologies (802.15.4, Bluetooth
      Low Energy, and RFID) on metrics like boundary sharpness, consistency,
      range, power consumption for indoor localization. Led the design and
      implementation of a magnetic-based proximity detection hardware platform.
      \item \textbf{SEPTIMU}. Designed the hardware platform (1cm by 1cm) which
      integrates 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, thermometer, photo-diode and
      microphone.
